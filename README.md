# Review Notes for Professional Machine Learning Engineer Certification Exam Topics

## Overview

Welcome to the cheatsheet for studying/review the Professional Machine Learning Engineer Certification exam topics. In this repository, you will find a single, LaTex-based cheatsheet with scientific topics related to the exam (still in Beta mode at the time of the initial release of this repo).

The cheatsheet was initially intended for those who have

* Taken college courses, online courses/MOOCs in data science &amp; machine learning
* Had hands-on experience with machine learning algorithms running on your local computers, such as _scikit-learning_ and _Keras_
* Had little experience with production-level ML (e.g. in GCP, AWS)

For this reason, I have re-structured the cheatsheet into the following **themes (sections)**:

1. Preparation for ML
2. ML Model Development
3. ML in Production

Section 2 should be familiar to most of the target audience, thus only includes only the relevant topics but not details. I recommend referencing the [scikit-learn User Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) and [Keras Developer Guides](https://keras.io/guides/), your favorite


## Releases

The repository was initially released on `07-16-2020`. It will likely be continuously updated, maintained, and debugged. If you are serious about getting well-prepared for this particular exam, (or even feeling a bit bored when staying at home alone during covid-19), consider

* Clone or fork this repository
* Add or expand sections that you believe important (or areas that you don't feel confident, wanting to learn more, etc.)
* Make changes or updates (e.g. places where you found typo or error)
* Or even better, make your own cheatsheet from scratch. Believe me, it isn't about what's on paper/screen but rather the process of making the cheatsheet (doing the research, thinking about the delivery...) that really helped

The template of the cheatsheet is freely available on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/a-quick-guide-to-latex-overleaf-version/bphpqrdgjyqy) with my customizations.
