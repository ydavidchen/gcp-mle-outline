# Review Notes for Professional Machine Learning Engineer Certification Exam Topics

## Overview

Welcome to the cheatsheet for studying/review the Professional Machine Learning Engineer Certification exam topics. In this repository, you will find a single, LaTex-based cheatsheet with scientific topics related to the certification exam, which are publicly available.

This cheatsheet was initially intended for folks who:

* Have taken college courses, online courses/MOOCs
* Have hands-on experience with machine learning algorithms running on your local computers, such as _scikit-learning_ and _Keras_
* But have _not_ run machine learning algorithms in the cloud

For this reason, I have re-structured the cheatsheet into **two major themes**:

* ML Prerequisites
* Review of Basic ML Concepts
* ML in Cloud

If you are serious about getting well-prepared for this particular exam, (or even feeling a bit bored when staying at home alone during covid-19), consider accepting my challenge of cloning this repository and:

* Add or expand sections that you believe important (or areas that you don't feel confident, wanting to learn more, etc.)
* Make changes or updates (e.g. places where you found typo or error)
* Or even better, make your own cheatsheet from scratch. Believe me, it isn't about what's on paper/screen but rather the process of making the cheatsheet (doing the research, thinking about the delivery...) that really helps

### References, Works Cited, Further Readings

* The main guide that led to this cheatsheet is the publicly available exam topic list from the exam provider. In essence, this guide consists of my "answers" or suggested solutions to the topics listed in the official exam topic list.
* The template of the cheatsheet is freely available on Overleaf with my customizations (presently, I lefted the original template \& watermark as is)
* Other references include numerous online posts/articles/blogs (e.g. from _Medium.com_, _StackExchange Network_, Wikepedia) and open-source documentations (e.g. _scikit-learn user guide_, various _GCP services/tools documentation_). I purposefully refrained from referring to any textbooks or commercialized resources (though they are excellent resources) due to copyright concerns.

### Important Disclaimers

The repository does not provide any actual information about the exam itself, which is under strict rules and regulations by the exam provider and the law.
